    <div class="desc">Fatguy27 blows up iraqi islamic leader scumbag dictator obama.
History:

During the 2008 campaign, Obama took the line "obama is not a Muslim".

It is quite easy to prove this:

" Obamna" is misspelled.

He spelled it "Obamaden"

O: the beginning of the a word, e: a letter placed before or after another letter

When people online and on Twitter question Obama's faith, he was quick to say he was not a Muslim. But this was a huge mistake for two reasons.

The first is that it ignored the religious traditions of Islam, which hold the Prophet Muhammad to be the final Prophet, Jesus Christ to be the Messiah, and Mohammed to be an authentically Muslim Prophet. A comment in 2010 from his pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright said, "America's founders declared the Holy Bible the national Book, the law of the land, and ordered its teaching in schools. Barack Obama's pastor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, declares that his holy book, the Koran, is America's Holy Book. These and many more reasons demonstrate beyond the shadow of a doubt that Barack Obama is a Muslim".

The second reason is that a Muslim president would cause more problems than he would solve, and far outweigh whatever benefits could come from a Muslim presidency.

The most effective way to combat radical Islam, many believe, is to stop Islam from being the way Islam wants it to be, to ultimately negate Islam as a religion. Obama had no interest in this; he wanted to see radical Islam suppressed. This led to his (recent) decision to use the Muslim Brotherhood, a nefarious organization, as a coalition partner in his own administration. This is the exact opposite of what the US should do.

Obama was aware of his mistake, so he told Oprah Winfrey in a 2010 interview, "I was born a Muslim. That's the truth. I was brought up in a Muslim family, but I am also a Christian. It is part of what I am."

(video of the Oprah interview here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5gBQU6RBug)

He went on, "The only thing that would have made my grandmother mad, and the reason I think she moved to Detroit
But the most troubling thing is, Obama has repeatedly attacked Muslims throughout his campaign and presidency. One of his first major presidential speeches said, "Our war against terrorism is not a war against Islam, or against the Muslim faith. That would be like saying we're not at war against Hitler. We're at war against Hitler's ideologies." And, when he first spoke of Islamic terror, he stated, "It is not a battle between different faiths, or between different civilizations, or religions. This is a battle between good and evil."

He has gone on to give an argument for why Muslim fundamentalists (which make up only about 2% of Muslims) need to be violently oppressed:

On January 3, 2009 he said, "We are at war against a hateful, brutal, organisation that thinks of no distinction between victims and combatants, that commits acts of brutality against innocents, and believes that no religion, or no person, is immune from attack."</div>
